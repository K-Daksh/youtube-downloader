# Catfish YouTube Downloader: The Fastest Way to Download High-Quality YouTube Videos

Hey there! Welcome to **Catfish YouTube Downloader**—my little project to make downloading YouTube videos as fast and easy as possible ⚡. It’s open-source, runs locally, and doesn’t mess around when it comes to speed. Best part? It’s super simple to set up. Let’s get started! 🎉

## How to Install

1. Clone the repo to your machine. You can do that by running:
    ```bash
    git clone <repo-url>
    ```

2. Download the `CatfishServer.exe` file and drop it where you want your videos saved.

3. Run `CatfishServer.exe`. Make sure it can run automatically next time (no need to keep clicking) 🔄.

4. Open your browser, go to the extensions page, and toggle on **Developer Mode**.

5. Hit ‘Load Unpacked’ and choose the `frontend` folder from your cloned repo.

Boom! Your download button will turn pink (because, why not?) 💖—that's how you know it's working.

## How to Use

Just click the shiny pink download button whenever you want to grab a video. It’ll save in the same folder as `CatfishServer.exe`, inside a folder called `download` 📥.

## Why Catfish?

Because who doesn't want to download videos fast ⚡, and who doesn’t like a little catfish in their life? 🐟 (Not the fish, the idea—get it?)

Plus, this is open-source. That means it’s not just my project—it’s *our* project. Let’s make it even better together! 🤝
